            <h1>About The House</h1>
            <p> <i> In the heart of the old town stands a house shrouded in mystery and fear, its crumbling walls echoing the secrets of the past. This house, like many others deemed haunted, has a history steeped in tragedy. Over the years, strange occurrences have plagued its halls—whispers in the dead of night, unexplained footsteps, and flickering lights, all signs of restless spirits that are said to reside within. Legends claim that these houses become haunted when souls with unresolved desires or tragic ends refuse to leave. With every passing year, the ghosts grow stronger, their presence felt by those brave enough to enter. Some believe that once a house has been touched by the supernatural, it becomes a permanent home for the otherworldly, trapping both the living and the dead in an eternal dance of fear.</i>
